# Recall Daily
This is a workflow to easily send daily emails with quotes and notes from books or other sources. This would be a simpler alternative to ReadWise or any other scheduler of quotes. 

It uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to run the code at certain defined timed intervals, however it can also be run locally or hosted somewhere else (with the required adjustments). At the time of writing this service is provided for free.
